title: Fourth Day at Eden

(This post is part of a series documenting my apprenticeship at Eden. For more,

Yesterday (the fourth day) was interesting because I was working on Eden as a
business, not directly on code. Most of the things I learnt were with regards
to marketing, as opposed to coding.

I did have some time to talk to Enrique about the wiki exercise. Reflecting on
this further, I realise that I completely overworked the testing side of the
assignment, to the expense of the actual code, a trap I have fallen into before.
The lesson I took away from this is to remember *why* writing tests is important;
which is that it helps deliver business value.

I am now going to redo the whole assignment (from scratch), concentrating more
on the actual wiki, and less on testing.
