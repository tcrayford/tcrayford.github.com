title: Sixth Day at Eden

(This post is part of a series documenting my apprenticeship at Eden. For more,

Yesterday was very fun. I worked with [aimee](http://twitter.com/sermoa) on a
client project, getting [Jasmine](http://github.com/pivotal/jasmine) working so
we could test some javascript that we wanted to refactor. To test that
we had to break up the code quite a bit, and then mock out things that
touch the DOM. This is mostly because we couldn't work out getting fixtures
generated for jasmine, so maybe we'll work on that today.

On another note, my typing (seeing as I'm participating in #learn2typewk) seems
to be getting worse. However, I'm somewhat aware of my problem areas now (pretty
much anything not on the home row), so I know what to work on. I've also started
a [Trickle List](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2008/08/18/the_trickle_list.html) for keeping track of
my typing practice.
